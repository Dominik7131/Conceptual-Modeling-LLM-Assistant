**TODO: Process info from the survey**

The assistant helps a human modeling expert in creating domain models. It suggests classes, attributes, and associations. You can work with or without a domain description. We support only English, not other languages!

If you do not provide a description, the assistant suggests anything it considers reasonable. In that case you can start by adding a class manually, e.g. "Patient" or "Train".

If you provide a description it strictly follows this description by suggesting only classes, attributes and associations described by the description. You can choose one of the following descriptions for your experiments with the assistant:
online gaming platform
data catalog
Video demonstrating the work with the domain description.

Video demonstrating the work without the domain description.

Video demonstrating combination of working with and without the domain description.

After you finish your experiments, please fill in the questionnaire below.

Tip: When hovering over a node click on the three vertical dots to suggest attributes and associations for the corresponding class.

Tip: You can drag an edge between two nodes and then click on "Suggest associations" button to suggest associations only between the corresponding two classes.

Tip: When considering a given suggestion in the right-hand side panel, you can use the edit and highlight buttons before adding the suggestion to the model.

Tip: When editing an attribute or association suggestion, you can also use "Change to attribute/association" button as the assistant can offer a given property in a form of attribute/association interchangably.

Tip: For each suggested class, attribute or association, use the description suggestion feature that is available on the right side of the dialog when editing any class, attribute or association.

Tip: As you approach to the model finalization use also the "Highlight original text" button at the bottom right corner of the Domain description text area. Use it to check what part of the domain description is already represented by the model

Tip: Hold shift and then left mouse button on the canvas to easily select multiple nodes and edges.
