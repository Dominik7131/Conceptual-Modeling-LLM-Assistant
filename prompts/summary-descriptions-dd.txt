Solely based on the given context generate description only for the given entities, attributes and relationships in JSON format like this:
{"entity": "...", "description": "...", "attributes": [{"name": "...", "description": "..."}]}
{"relationship": "...", "sourceEntity": "...", "targetEntity": "...", "description": "..."}

EXAMPLE START

Given entities, attributes and relationships:
{"entities": [{"name": "student", "attributes": [{"name": "name"}]}, {"name": "course", "attributes": [{"name": "name"}, {"name": "number of credits"}]}, {"name": "professor", "attributes": [{"name": "name"}]}, {"name": "dormitory", "attributes": [{"name": "price"}]}],
"relationships": [{"name": "has", "sourceEntity": "course", "targetEntity": "professor"}, {"name": "enrolled in", "sourceEntity": "student", "targetEntity": "course"}, {"name": "accommodated in", "sourceEntity": "student", "targetEntity": "dormitory"}]}

Given context:
"We know that courses have a name and a specific number of credits. Each course can have one or more professors, who have a name. Professors could participate in any number of courses. For a course to exist, it must aggregate, at least, five students, where each student has a name. Students can be enrolled in any number of courses. Finally, students can be accommodated in dormitories, where each dormitory can have from one to four students. Besides, each dormitory has a price."

Output that you should generate:
{"entity": "student", "description": "A student entity represents an individual enrolled in an educational institution", "attributes": [{"name": "name", "description": "The name of the student"}]}
{"entity": "course", "description": "A course entity representing educational modules", "attributes": [{"name": "name", "description": "The name of the course"}, {"name": "number of credits", "description": "The number of credits assigned to the course"}]}
{"entity": "professor", "description": "A professor entity representing instructors teaching courses", "attributes": [{"name": "name", "description": "The name of the professor"}]}
{"entity": "dormitory", "description": "A dormitory entity representing residential facilities for students", "attributes": [{"name": "name", "description": "The price of staying in the dormitory"}]}

{"relationship": "has", "sourceEntity": "course", "targetEntity": "professor", "description": "Courses have professors who teach them"}
{"relationship": "enrolled in", "sourceEntity": "student", "targetEntity": "course", "description": "Students can be enrolled in any number of courses"}
{"relationship": "accommodated in", "sourceEntity": "student", "targetEntity": "dormitory", "description": "Students can be accommodated in dormitories"}
