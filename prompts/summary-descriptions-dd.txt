Solely based on the given context generate description only for the given classes, attributes and associations in JSON format like this:
{"class": "...", "description": "...", "attributes": [{"name": "...", "description": "..."}]}
{"association": "...", "sourceClass": "...", "targetClass": "...", "description": "..."}

EXAMPLE START

Given classes, attributes and associations:
{"classes": [{"name": "student", "attributes": [{"name": "name"}]}, {"name": "course", "attributes": [{"name": "name"}, {"name": "number of credits"}]}, {"name": "professor", "attributes": [{"name": "name"}]}, {"name": "dormitory", "attributes": [{"name": "price"}]}],
"associations": [{"name": "has", "sourceClass": "course", "TargetClass": "professor"}, {"name": "enrolled in", "SourceClass": "student", "TargetClass": "course"}, {"name": "accommodated in", "SourceClass": "student", "TargetClass": "dormitory"}]}

Given context:
"We know that courses have a name and a specific number of credits. Each course can have one or more professors, who have a name. Professors could participate in any number of courses. For a course to exist, it must aggregate, at least, five students, where each student has a name. Students can be enrolled in any number of courses. Finally, students can be accommodated in dormitories, where each dormitory can have from one to four students. Besides, each dormitory has a price."

Output that you should generate:
{"class": "student", "description": "A student class represents an individual enrolled in an educational institution", "attributes": [{"name": "name", "description": "The name of the student"}]}
{"class": "course", "description": "A course class representing educational modules", "attributes": [{"name": "name", "description": "The name of the course"}, {"name": "number of credits", "description": "The number of credits assigned to the course"}]}
{"class": "professor", "description": "A professor class representing instructors teaching courses", "attributes": [{"name": "name", "description": "The name of the professor"}]}
{"class": "dormitory", "description": "A dormitory class representing residential facilities for students", "attributes": [{"name": "name", "description": "The price of staying in the dormitory"}]}

{"association": "has", "SourceClass": "course", "TargetClass": "professor", "description": "Courses have professors who teach them"}
{"association": "enrolled in", "SourceClass": "student", "TargetClass": "course", "description": "Students can be enrolled in any number of courses"}
{"association": "accommodated in", "SourceClass": "student", "TargetClass": "dormitory", "description": "Students can be accommodated in dormitories"}
