Solely based on the given context which associations are explicitly between the source class "employee" and the target class "department"?

This is the given context:
"In this company, every employee, whether works in accounting, marketing, or any other department with some other title, has a specific role. An employee has a personal number, that uniquely identifies the employee and name the other employees in the company use to address the employee. Each one works in just one department, which is a part of how the company organizes its work. Some employees are also managers; they still do much of what other employees do, but they also have extra responsibilities depending on their level in the company hierarchy."

Output:
{"originalText": "employee, whether works in accounting, marketing, or any other department with some other title ... Each one works in just one department, which is a part of how the company organizes its work.", "name": "works in", "source": "employee", "target": "department"}
