\chapter{LLM-based Modeling Assistant Framework}

We propose solving the automation of these domain modeling steps as text generation problems similarly to \citet{Chen2023}, where the authors consider a domain description $T$ with an underlying ground truth model $M$, and approach the problem of model generation as the problem of defining a text generator $f$ with $M' = f(T)$, where $M'$ is the generated model similar to $M$. The generator $f$ is an LLM-based operator defined by a predesigned prompt that instructs an LLM to return a structured textual representation of $M'$ for the input $T$. \\

\section{Generators}

We consider more fine-grained text generation problems solved by the following generators:

\textbf{Class generator}: $gen_c$ that for $T$ suggests classes $\{C_1, \ldots, C_n\}$ each with a suggested $name(Ci)$.

\textbf{Attribute generator}: $gen_a$ that for $T$ and a class $C$ suggests attributes $\{P_1, \ldots, P_n\}$, each with $source(P_i) = C$, suggested $name(P_i)$, and original text $orig(Pi)$ that is part of $T$ on which base $gen_a$ suggested $P_i$.

\textbf{Association generator 1}: $gen_r$ that for $T$ and a class $C$ suggests associations $\{P_1, \ldots, P_n\}$, each with $source(P_i) = C$ (or $target(Pi) = C$), suggested $name(Pi)$, and with the original text $orig(P_i)$ that is part of $T$ on which base $gen_r$ suggested $P_i$. It also suggests the other class $D$, with $target(Pi)= D$ (or $source(Pi) = D$), and suggested $name(D)$. \\
