\section*{Motivation}
When a team is working on any project, it is beneficial to unify the language and define the terms 
that everyone will use. This is addressed by creating conceptual models. In a nutshell, conceptual 
models capture classes, their attributes and associations. However, creating these conceptual 
models takes a non-trivial amount of time and requires trained experts (TODO: cite source 18 from our article?). \\

Recently, there has been a lot of progress in the development of Large Language Models (LLMs) such 
as ChatGPT (TODO: Cite ChatGPT and maybe cite source [5] from Automated Domain Modeling with LLMs A Comparative Study). We hypothesize that these LLMs could be used in such a way as to make it easier for 
users to create conceptual models. We know that current LLMs are not smart enough to directly 
create the conceptual model one expects for a given textual description (TODO: cite). However, one possible solution is to use an LLM as an assistant, which we see around us a lot today (e.g. Copilot) (TODO: cite Copilot). \\



\section*{Goals}
Aim of this thesis is to create this aforementioned LLM assistant that cooperates with a human modeling expert. The expert provides unstructured domain description as input into the domain modeling process.
This assistant is mainly intended to help users to make conceptual models faster and also to help the users to better describe their newly created conceptual models. This assistant should be:
\begin{enumerate}
\item intuitive to use
\item suggesting mostly appropriate classes, attributes and associations
\item suggesting mostly appropriate descriptions of classes, attributes and associations
\item able to summarize a selected part of user's conceptual model
\item able to highlight in the domain description what the user has already modeled \\
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Publication}
We created an article summarizing our main findings and submitted it into the International Conference on Conceptual Modeling ER 2024. (TODO: reference (https://insights.sei.cmu.edu/news/international-conference-on-conceptual-modeling-er-2024-opens-call-for-papers/)?)
