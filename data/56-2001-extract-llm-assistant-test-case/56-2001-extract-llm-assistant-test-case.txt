The Road Vehicle Register is a public administration information system. It contains records of road vehicles, the owners and operators of these vehicles, lost, stolen, damaged and destroyed road vehicle registration certificates and registration plates.

For the purposes of regulating the conditions of operation of road vehicles on roads, a road vehicle is a motorised or non-motorised vehicle which is constructed for use on roads for the carriage of persons, animals or goods.
A special vehicle is a road vehicle manufactured for purposes other than road traffic, which may be operated on roads if conditions are met.
A road vehicle category is a group of road vehicles which have the same technical conditions laid down in an implementing regulation.
Road vehicles and special vehicles are divided into categories L, M, N, O, T, C, R, S and Z.
A type of road vehicle is defined as a set of road vehicles which are identical in at least their basic characteristics. A road vehicle type may include variants and versions.
Road vehicles are divided into the following basic types: motorcycles, passenger cars, buses, lorries, special purpose vehicles, trailers, powered wheelchairs if their width or length exceeds 1.4 m, their design speed exceeds 15 km.h-1 or their maximum permissible weight exceeds 450 kg, and other road vehicles.
Special vehicles are divided into the following basic types: agricultural or forestry tractors and their trailers, self-propelled work machines, work machines carried, work machines attached, interchangeable towed equipment, vehicles designed primarily for driving on snow, vehicles designed primarily for off-road driving, single-axle tractors and their trailers, special tractors and their trailers, carriers of working adaptors and other special vehicles.
A trailer is a non-motorised vehicle intended to be towed by another road vehicle to which it is coupled in a combination.
Road vehicle system means any structural system of a road vehicle which is subject to the technical requirements laid down in an implementing regulation. An example of a road vehicle system is brakes or emission reduction devices.
A structural component of a road vehicle is a component of the road vehicle which must be type-approved independently of the road vehicle if so provided for in the implementing legislation and which is subject to the technical requirements laid down in the implementing legislation. An example of a structural component of a road vehicle is a lamp.

When registering a road vehicle in the register of road vehicles, the municipal authority of the municipality with extended competence shall issue a certificate of registration of the road vehicle to the applicant.

The municipal authority of the municipality with extended competence, when registering a road vehicle in the register of road vehicles, shall further assign a registration plate to the road vehicle.
The registration plate shall consist of a combination of capital letters of the Latin alphabet and Arabic numerals.
When issuing a registration plate, the municipal authority of the municipality with extended jurisdiction shall affix a sticker to the plate issued, indicating the date of the periodic technical inspection. If the road vehicle has been found to be seriously defective, the municipal authority of the municipality with extended jurisdiction shall mark on the sticker the date of the repeated technical inspection, which shall be the last day of the month following the month of registration of the road vehicle in the register of road vehicles. If the road vehicle has been found to be dangerously defective, the municipal authority of the municipality with extended jurisdiction shall not affix the sticker to the registration plate.

Green Card means an international certificate proving that the road vehicle has been covered by a third party insurance contract for the road vehicle specified in the certificate. Liability insurance is based on an insurance contract concluded between the policyholder and the insurer. The insurer is an insurance company authorised to operate liability insurance in the Czech Republic. The policyholder is the person who has concluded a contract of liability insurance with the insurer. The insurance contract shall always contain the designation of the insurer and the policyholder and the particulars of the road vehicle, the duration of the insurance, the limit of the insurance benefit, the amount of the premium, its maturity and the method of payment and the form and place of notification of the claim.


The operator of a road vehicle which has not been registered in another State prior to its registration in the Register of Road Vehicles shall bring the road vehicle in for a technical inspection within 4 years from the date of registration of the road vehicle in the Register of Road Vehicles and periodically thereafter within 2 years from the date of the previous technical inspection.

A road vehicle technical inspection is an inspection of its roadworthiness which includes the technical condition and functioning of a road vehicle, its systems, components and separate technical units and their environmental impact or a registration test of a road vehicle.
A technical inspection station is a workplace specialised in carrying out technical inspections of road vehicles.
A technical inspection station may be operated by a legal or natural person who has a licence to operate it and a certificate issued by the regional authority. The competent authority to decide on the granting of the authorisation is the regional authority in whose administrative district the operator of the technical inspection station will carry out its activities.

Emissions measurement as part of the technical inspection can be carried out at the emission measurement station before other inspection tasks are carried out at the technical inspection station. The emission measurement station shall draw up a report on the emission measurement which shall be handed over to the natural person who brought the road vehicle to the emission measurement station.
The inspection technician of the technical inspection station shall include the results of the emission measurement in the technical inspection report. In such a case, the day on which the other checking operations were carried out in the framework of the periodic technical inspection at the technical inspection station shall be considered as the day on which the periodic technical inspection of the road vehicle was carried out. If more than 30 days have elapsed between the date on which the emission measurement was carried out and the date on which the road vehicle was brought in for the other checking operations, the emission measurement carried out shall not be taken into account.

During a technical inspection the technical inspection station shall determine whether the technical condition and operation of the road vehicle, its systems, structural parts and separate technical units are free from defects or have defects by comparing the actual technical condition of the road vehicle with the conditions laid down for the technical condition of the road vehicle.
On the basis of the defect record, the technical inspection station shall draw up a technical inspection report on the technical inspection of the road vehicle and hand it over to the natural person who delivered the road vehicle for the technical inspection.

The registration inspection report for a road vehicle shall cease to be valid if, after the registration inspection has been carried out
- changes have been made to the road vehicle which are not in accordance with the information entered in the register of road vehicles, in the registration certificate of the road vehicle or in a similar document issued by a Member State other than the Member State on the date of the check; or
- a reduction in the distance travelled on the odometer of the road vehicle.
These rules shall apply mutatis mutandis to emission measurements carried out at an emission measurement station.

The technical inspection of a road vehicle can detect 3 levels of defects, which are
- a minor defect which does not significantly affect the operational characteristics of the road vehicle, road safety or the environment,
- a serious defect which affects the operational characteristics of the road vehicle, is liable to endanger road traffic, may adversely affect the environment or consists of a serious deficiency in the identification of the road vehicle, or
- a dangerous defect which poses an immediate threat to the safety of the road vehicle, to road traffic or to the environment.

A road vehicle is technically fit for use on the road if no defects or only minor defects have been found during the road vehicle inspection. If the technical inspection has revealed minor defects, the operator of the road vehicle shall remedy them. The technical inspection station shall affix an inspection sticker on the rear plate of the registration plate of the road vehicle indicating the month and year of the next periodic technical inspection of the road vehicle.

If a technical inspection reveals a serious defect, the road vehicle is technically fit for use only for 30 days from the date of issue of the technical inspection report. Within this period, the operator of the road vehicle shall be obliged to bring the road vehicle with the rectified serious defect to the technical inspection station for a repeat technical inspection. If the operator of the road vehicle does not proceed in this way, or if the repeated technical inspection reveals that the defect to be rectified has been recurrently rectified, the road vehicle is technically unfit for use and may not be used in traffic. The operator shall be obliged to ensure that the road vehicle is towed away from the technical inspection station at his own expense.

If the technical inspection of a road vehicle reveals a dangerous defect, the road vehicle is technically unfit for use and must not be used in traffic. The operator is obliged to ensure that the road vehicle is towed at his own expense from the technical inspection station, that the dangerous defect is removed, and that the road vehicle is brought in for a repeat technical inspection. Upon detection of a dangerous defect, the technical inspection station shall remove the technical inspection sticker from the rear plate of the registration plate.
