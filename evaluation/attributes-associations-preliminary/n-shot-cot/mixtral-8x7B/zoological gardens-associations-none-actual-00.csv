manages,zoologist,zoologist,animal reproductive details,"Reproductive details of animal species include reproductive health and management information that is paramount in zoological settings, especially for conservation breeding programs. First, the age at which the species is capable of reproducing, which helps in planning breeding programs, is important. This takes us also to the specific time of year when the animals of that species naturally breed, which can influence how enclosures are managed and when animals are introduced for mating. Gestation period, which is the length of pregnancy in viviparous species, is important for monitoring and providing care during this critical period. For oviparous species, the number of eggs typically laid at one time, affects incubation practices.",,,
designs,zoologist,zoologist,enclosure,"Enclosures are specialized habitats designed to mimic the natural environments of the resident species. They are critical for the ethical display and conservation of animals. Each enclosure is characterized by its size in square meters, type (e.g., aviary, aquarium, terrarium), climate conditions, and vegetation, tailored to the needs of specific species in the enclosure.",,,
manages,zoologist,zoologist,enclosure climate conditions,"The climate conditions of enclosures in zoological gardens are complex and need to be tailored specifically to the needs of each species. They are a blend of various controlled environmental factors including temperature, humidity, lighting, and ventilation. These climate conditions are essential for mimicking the natural habitat of animals as closely as possible, which not only ensures their physical health but also supports their psychological well-being by encouraging natural behaviors and physiological functions. Temperature is perhaps the most critical element in an enclosure's climate conditions. Each species has a specific thermal preference based on its natural habitat, which needs to be mimicked in captivity for optimal health. Many animal species, particularly reptiles, require a range of temperatures within their enclosure to regulate their body temperature by moving between warmer and cooler areas. Humidity levels are vital and important aspect of climate conditions, especially for species from tropical or aquatic environments, as it affects skin health, hydration, and overall comfort. Ensuring that light cycles (day and night) in the climate conditions of enclosures are consistent with the natural light patterns of an animal's native habitat helps maintain normal circadian rhythms, which are crucial for feeding, sleeping, and reproductive behaviors. Many species, particularly reptiles, require climate conditions ensuring an exposure to ultraviolet light to synthesize vitamin D3, essential for calcium metabolism. The absence of adequate UV lighting in the climate conditions can lead to health problems like metabolic bone disease. Proper ventilation is essential for maintaining air quality and appropriate climate conditions within an enclosure.",,,
works with,zoologist,zoologist,staff member,"Staff members of zoological gardens are integral to their operation. They include zoologists, veterinarians, caretakers, and administrative personnel. Each staff member has a name and expertise. For the administrative purposes, we need to keep staff member's birth date and permanent address. Their expertise directly affects animal welfare. Caretakers and zoologists are assigned to particular enclosures they are responsible for. Caretakers can be assigned to more enclosures and they are responsible for daily care and behavioral training of the animals in the enclosure. An enclosure must have more caretakers so that they cover non-stop care which is necessary for most species. Veterinarians are responsible for medical treatment of particular species. Therefore, they are not assigned to enclosures or individual animals but species.",,,
