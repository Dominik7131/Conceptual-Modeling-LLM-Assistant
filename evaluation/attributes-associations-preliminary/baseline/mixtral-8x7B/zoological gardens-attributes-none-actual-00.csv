climate conditions,oviparous species,"The climate conditions of enclosures in zoological gardens are complex and need to be tailored specifically to the needs of each species. They are a blend of various controlled environmental factors including temperature, humidity, lighting, and ventilation. These climate conditions are essential for mimicking the natural habitat of animals as closely as possible, which not only ensures their physical health but also supports their psychological well-being by encouraging natural behaviors and physiological functions. Temperature is perhaps the most critical element in an enclosure's climate conditions. Each species has a specific thermal preference based on its natural habitat, which needs to be mimicked in captivity for optimal health. Many animal species, particularly reptiles, require a range of temperatures within their enclosure to regulate their body temperature by moving between warmer and cooler areas. Humidity levels are vital and important aspect of climate conditions, especially for species from tropical or aquatic environments, as it affects skin health, hydration, and overall comfort. Ensuring that light cycles (day and night) in the climate conditions of enclosures are consistent with the natural light patterns of an animal's native habitat helps maintain normal circadian rhythms, which are crucial for feeding, sleeping, and reproductive behaviors. Many species, particularly reptiles, require climate conditions ensuring an exposure to ultraviolet light to synthesize vitamin D3, essential for calcium metabolism. The absence of adequate UV lighting in the climate conditions can lead to health problems like metabolic bone disease. Proper ventilation is essential for maintaining air quality and appropriate climate conditions within an enclosure.",climate conditions,,*
