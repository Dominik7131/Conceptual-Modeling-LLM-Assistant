They are critical for the ethical display and conservation of animals. A zoological garden provides various enclosures where its animals live and are ethically displayed and conserved. Each enclosure is characterized by its size in square meters, type (e.g., aviary, aquarium, terrarium), climate conditions, and vegetation, tailored to the needs of specific species in the enclosure. The design and maintenance of enclosures are vital for health, providing adequate space, enrichment, and security from potential stressors for each animal housed in the enclosure.",enclosure,,provides

They include zoologists, veterinarians, caretakers, and administrative personnel. Each staff member has a name and expertise. For the administrative purposes, we need to keep staff member's birth date and permanent address. Their expertise directly affects animal welfare. Caretakers and zoologists are assigned to particular enclosures they are responsible for. Caretakers can be assigned to more enclosures and they are responsible for daily care and behavioral training of the animals in the enclosure. An enclosure must have more caretakers so that they cover non-stop care which is necessary for most species. Veterinarians are responsible for medical treatment of particular species. Therefore, they are not assigned to enclosures or individual animals but species.",staff member,,has member
