cultivated,crop,crop,plant,"Crops are plants cultivated in large amounts for profit or subsistence, including cereals, oil seeds, vegetables, and fruits. The cultivated variety of a crop is a critical classification. It is a plant grouping, within a single botanical taxon of the lowest known rank, defined by the reproducible expression of its distinguishing and other genetic characteristics. Vegetables and fruits are subcategories of crops, with vegetables including plants cultivated for their parts consumable by humans or other animals as food. and fruits cultivated for their seed-associated fleshy structures that typically are sweet or sour and edible in the raw state, such as apples, bananas, grapes, lemons, oranges, and strawberries.. Seed plants, another subclass, are grown for oil production from seeds, like sunflower and soybean, significant for both food and industrial uses. We also distinguish cereal as a plant cultivated for its edible grain.",,cultivated variety,
